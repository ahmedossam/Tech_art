# Comparison of MEL Script, MaxScript (FBX), and Custom MaxScript (OBJ)

| **Feature**                | **MEL Script (Maya)**                                   | **First MaxScript (FBX)**                           | **Custom MaxScript (OBJ)**                        |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Script Type**             | Maya Embedded Language (MEL)                           | MaxScript for 3ds Max                                | MaxScript for 3ds Max                             |
| **File Export Format**      | FBX                                                    | FBX                                                 | OBJ                                               |
| **Substance Painter Launch**| Uses `system()` to execute the command in the shell     | Uses `shellLaunch` to open Substance Painter         | Uses `systemTools.launch` to execute the command  |
| **Performance (Export Time)**| Comparable for exporting FBX models; dependent on file size | Similar FBX export performance, with basic FBX settings | Slightly faster due to lightweight OBJ export     |
| **Performance (Launch Time)**| Minimal difference; dependent on Substance Painter load time | Same, as it opens the external program              | Same, since Substance Painter loading is constant |
| **Error Handling**          | Basic (checks for selection and file existence)        | Basic (checks for selection and file existence)      | Improved (additional handling for no selection)   |
| **Integration Ease**        | Requires path setup and plugin loading (FBX plugin)    | Requires proper path setup for export and Substance Painter | Requires proper path setup for OBJ export and Substance Painter |
| **User Flexibility**        | Can be enhanced with Maya's additional commands        | Supports basic functionality with minimal prompts    | Easier export format (OBJ) with fewer prompts     |
| **Customization Options**   | FBX export options can be customized for specific needs | FBX export parameters can be customized (e.g., Smoothing Groups) | Limited customization (OBJ export only)          |
| **File Format**             | FBX is widely used for transferring 3D data between software | FBX is useful for complex meshes with animation support | OBJ is a lighter format, good for simple meshes   |
| **Computation Time (Export)** | Slightly slower due to FBX being a more complex format | Same as MEL (FBX export), potentially slower than OBJ | Faster since OBJ is lightweight compared to FBX   |
| **Pros**                    | Native to Maya; flexible and well-integrated with Mayaâ€™s workflow | Integrates with 3ds Max well; FBX supports animations and complex structures | Lightweight, faster export for simple meshes; improved error handling |
| **Cons**                    | Requires proper FBX plugin setup; potentially slower FBX export | FBX can be overkill for simple models; requires handling of plugin and paths | Less flexible than FBX for complex animations and structures |
