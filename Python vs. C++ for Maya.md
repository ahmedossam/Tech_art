# 🆚 Python vs. C++ for Maya Tool Development

This table compares Python and C++ for creating tools in Autodesk Maya, helping you choose the right language for your needs.

| **Feature**               | **Python** 🐍  | **C++** 🚀  |
|---------------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Ease of Use**           | Easy to learn, write, and debug. | More complex, requires deep programming knowledge. |
| **Development Speed**     | Fast prototyping and iteration. | Slower due to compilation and debugging. |
| **Performance**           | Slower for heavy computations. | High performance, better for large-scale operations. |
| **Interactivity**         | Runs scripts instantly without restarting Maya. | Requires recompilation and plugin reloads. |
| **API Integration**       | Uses `maya.cmds`, `pymel`, `OpenMaya` for scripting. | Uses `OpenMaya` for deep engine integration. |
| **Memory Management**     | Handled automatically (garbage collection). | Manual memory handling, more efficient for large operations. |
| **Tool Types**            | Best for UI, automation, batch processing, and scene management. | Best for performance-heavy tools, custom nodes, and deformers. |
| **Plugin Deployment**     | No compilation needed, works across Maya versions. | Needs compilation per Maya version and OS. |
| **Extensibility**         | Great for pipeline automation and quick fixes. | Allows creating deep system modifications and real-time operations. |
| **Examples of Tools**     | Batch Renamer, Auto Exporter, Scene Cleanup Tool. | Custom Deformers, Real-time Mesh Processing, Custom Render Nodes. |

## 🚀 Which One Should You Use?
- **Use Python** 🐍 for quick scripting, automation, and UI tools.
- **Use C++** 🚀 for high-performance applications and deep integration.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Use Python for scripting/UI and C++ for performance-critical tasks.
